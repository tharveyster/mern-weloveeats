# MERN WeLoveEeats

This project is an attempt to refactor my PHP/MySQL website (WeLoveEats.com) into a MERN-stack site. This MERN-stack will be MySql, Express, React, and Node.

Original website: [weloveeats.com](https://weloveeats.com)

## Items Completed
The home page is complete, and shows everything the original page does except for ads.

The category page is also complete except for ads.

The recipe page currently shows the category, title, origin (if known), number of servings, full ingredient list, directions, picture(s), nutrition information, Weight Watchers points, and a view counter (increments on each visit).

The navigation menu has the home page, all of the recipe categories, and the sign up page.

There is a sign up page that validates user input to ensure it complies with site requirements, and then creates new user accounts.

There's components that show 5 random recipes, 5 most viewed recipes, and 5 most liked recipes, that appear on most of the pages.
